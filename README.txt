This is my group's final project for CSCE 473 Computer Vision at University of Nebraska Lincoln (UNL).

The images were taken at the Animal Science Complex Lab at UNL.

In the Report and Slides folder you can find our pdf with the final report, the slides we used for the presentation and the project proposal. PLEASE NOTE: the proposal is unchanged from what we originally submitted. Therefore, the objectives listed are not the same as the final objectives, since we had to change them because the original ones were almost impossible.

In the code folder you can find the code for the 2 deep learning models 
(model 2 is the one for third objective) and the code for the texture 
segmentation. You can also find the code we used for testing. The 
intersection over union is for evaluate the texture segmentation. You can 
also find the matlab app we created for the texture segmentation. For the app to work, the image selected by the user should be located in the same folder ass the app file (so just move the image you want to use to the code folder).
You can use these codes to test our project. Just run the models (changing the image paths accordingly) or the texture segmentation (or the app) doing the same thing.

In the TestImages folder you can find the folders with images for the model that 
detect the type of feed (class 1,2,3), and the other folders were both 
used for the first deep learning model and texture segmentation. 
PLEASE NOTE: We used this images for testing. The training images are not here since the folder is getting a big size and we don't want to have problems with submission in canvas. Just note that these images are taken from the same datasets that those used for training, so you can have an idea of how are they. If you really need the training images, please let us know and we will try to find a way to send them to you.
